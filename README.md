## 1. What is an Activity in Android?

Answer: An Activity represents a single screen with a user interface. For example, an email application might have one activity that shows a list of new emails, another activity to compose an email, and another activity for reading emails. Each activity is independent of the others and can be launched individually.

Example code:

```java
public class MainActivity extends Activity {
   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
      setContentView(R.layout.activity_main);
   }
}
```

## 2. What is a Fragment in Android?

Answer: A Fragment represents a behavior or a portion of the user interface in an Activity. You can combine multiple fragments in a single activity to build a multi-pane UI and reuse a fragment in multiple activities.

Example code:

``` java
public class ExampleFragment extends Fragment {
   @Override
   public View onCreateView(LayoutInflater inflater, ViewGroup container,
         Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      // Inflate the layout for this fragment
      return inflater.inflate(R.layout.example_fragment, container, false);
   }
}
```

## 3. What is a Service in Android?

Answer: A Service is a component that runs in the background to perform long-running operations or to perform work for remote processes.

Example code:

```java
public class ExampleService extends Service {
   @Override
   public int onStartCommand(Intent intent, int flags, int startId) {
      // Do some work here
      return START_STICKY;
   }
}
```

## 4. What is a BroadcastReceiver in Android?

Answer: A BroadcastReceiver is a component that responds to system-wide broadcast announcements. Many broadcasts originate from the system—for example, a broadcast announcing that the screen has turned off, the battery is low, or a picture was captured. Applications can also initiate broadcasts—for example, to let other applications know that some data has been downloaded to the device and is available for them to use.

Example code:

```java
public class ExampleReceiver extends BroadcastReceiver {
   @Override
   public void onReceive(Context context, Intent intent) {
      // Do something here
   }
}
```

## 5. What is a ContentProvider in Android?

Answer: A ContentProvider manages a shared set of application data. You can store the data in the file system, in a SQLite database, on the web, or any other persistent storage location your application can access.

Example code:

```java
public class ExampleProvider extends ContentProvider {
   @Override
   public boolean onCreate() {
      // Initialize your provider here
      return true;
   }
}
```

## 6. What is an Intent in Android?

Answer: An Intent is a messaging object that you can use to request an action from another app component. For example, you can use an intent to start an activity, to start a service, or to deliver a broadcast.

Example code:

```scss
Intent intent = new Intent(this, ExampleActivity.class);
startActivity(intent);
```

## 7. What is an AsyncTask in Android?

Answer: An AsyncTask is a class that helps you perform background operations and publish results on the UI thread without having to manipulate threads and/or handlers.

Example code:

```kotlin
public class ExampleTask extends AsyncTask<Void, Void, Void> {
   @Override
   protected Void doInBackground(Void... params) {
      // Do some background work here
      return null;
   }

   @Override
   protected void onPostExecute(Void result) {
      // Update the UI thread here
   }
}
```

## 8. What is a RecyclerView in Android?

Answer: A RecyclerView is a more advanced and flexible version of the ListView. It is used to display a large data set efficiently by reusing views as the user scrolls through the data.

Example code

```java
public class ExampleAdapter extends RecyclerView.Adapter<ExampleAdapter.ViewHolder> {
   // ViewHolder class definition

   @Override
   public ViewHolder onCreateViewHolder(ViewGroup parent, int viewType) {
      // Inflate the item layout and create the ViewHolder
      View itemView = LayoutInflater.from(parent.getContext())
            .inflate(R.layout.example_item, parent, false);
      return new ViewHolder(itemView);
   }

   @Override
   public void onBindViewHolder(ViewHolder holder, int position) {
      // Bind data to the ViewHolder
      holder.bind(dataList.get(position));
   }

   @Override
   public int getItemCount() {
      return dataList.size();
   }

   public class ViewHolder extends RecyclerView.ViewHolder {
      // ViewHolder implementation
   }
}
```

## 9. What is the difference between Serializable and Parcelable in Android?

Answer: Serializable and Parcelable are both mechanisms to transfer data between components in Android. Serializable is a default Java mechanism, while Parcelable is an Android-specific mechanism that provides better performance. Parcelable requires explicit implementation but is faster and more efficient for passing large amounts of data.

Example code for Parcelable implementation:

```java
public class ExampleModel implements Parcelable {
   // Model class implementation

   protected ExampleModel(Parcel in) {
      // Read data from parcel
   }

   @Override
   public void writeToParcel(Parcel dest, int flags) {
      // Write data to parcel
   }

   @Override
   public int describeContents() {
      return 0;
   }

   public static final Creator<ExampleModel> CREATOR = new Creator<ExampleModel>() {
      @Override
      public ExampleModel createFromParcel(Parcel in) {
         return new ExampleModel(in);
      }

      @Override
      public ExampleModel[] newArray(int size) {
         return new ExampleModel[size];
      }
   };
}
```

## 10. What is the Android Support Library?

Answer: The Android Support Library is a set of code libraries that provide backward-compatible versions of Android framework APIs. It allows developers to use new APIs and features on older versions of Android by providing compatibility wrappers.

## 11. What is Dependency Injection (DI) in Android?

Answer: Dependency Injection is a design pattern and a technique in which one object supplies the dependencies of another object. It helps to improve the modularity and testability of an application by reducing the direct dependencies between components.

Example code using Dagger 2 for Dependency Injection:

```java
public class ExampleActivity extends AppCompatActivity {
   @Inject
   ExampleDependency exampleDependency;

   @Override
   protected void onCreate(Bundle savedInstanceState) {
      super.onCreate(savedInstanceState);
      setContentView(R.layout.activity_example);

      // Inject dependencies
      DaggerExampleComponent.builder()
            .exampleModule(new ExampleModule())
            .build()
            .inject(this);

      // Use the injected dependency
      exampleDependency.doSomething();
   }
}
```
